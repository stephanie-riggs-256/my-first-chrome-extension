# Chrome Extension

This is a Chrome Extension project that I have created to get started with building Chrome Extensions.

I hope to eventually develop my own Chrome Extension in order to make it easier to sign up for shifts at my job. For now, I am planning on practising creating Chrome Extensions.

I started with following this tutorial for this project: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/
I hope to make deviations from this to improve my project and make it my own.
